##Variant No.22
![ ](/img/var22.png)

## For this lab it was required to:
1.**_Write a program which converts regular grammar to Finite Automaton (FA)._**

2.**_Using Finite Automaton (FA) check if some input string is accepted by FA  (meaning you could generate that string by traversing FA)_**

![Grammar that respects the grammar rules](/img/test1.png)

![Grammar that don't respect the grammar rules](/img/test2.png)

3.**_Bonus Point -> Using some graphic library plot FA graph_**

4.**_Determine the grammar type by the Chromsky classification_**

According to the Chomsky classification of grammars, this grammar is of type 3 (Right-Linear Grammar) as it satisfies the two conditions: 
1.S->aS
2.S->a
